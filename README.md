# NBA-Potential-Assists
Research around the Potential Assist Stat in the NBA, and how accurately it predicts how many assists a player will have

First Update - importing the data and making preliminary graphs. 
Took the Top 50 players in assists from https://www.nba.com/stats/players/passing and made it a CSV, and import it into Pandas
The graphs have Assists on the X axis, with Potential assists, AST to Pass %, and Potential Assist Per Assist on the Y axis. 
These graphs were made to see if there were any big correlations to the Assist stat, which the Potential Assist one is fairly linear
